The database can be queried about <b>authors</b>, papers, conferences, organizations, citations and topics.
It is possible to further filter the queries by specifying the name of a particular topic, conference, organization or author.
The results can be sorted according to one of the following four options: publications, citations, publications in the last 5 years, citations in the last 5 years
There are three types of queries:
<ol>
  <li> Describe (e.g .: "describe ISWC")</li>
  <li> Count (e.g .: "count the papers on machine learning")</li>
  <li> List (e.g .: "list the top 5 conferences with papers on rdf graph sorted by publications").</li>
</ol>

You can enter a query all at once in natural language or through a wizard by entering one of the three activation words: describe, count or list.
The audio functions use the Web Speech API which is defined as experimental technology and may not work correctly depending on the compatibility of the browser used, therefore the options to activate them are only available on fully compatible browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari: all functions - Mozilla Firefox: only the speech syntetizer).
